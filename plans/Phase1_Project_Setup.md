This phase establishes the foundational project structure and dependencies for DSPy.ts. We'll set up the development environment, install necessary packages, and create basic configuration files.

  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "DSPy.ts - Declarative Self-Learning TypeScript: A framework for compositional LM pipelines with self-improving prompt strategies.",
  "main": "dist/index.js",

Once this phase is complete, proceed to Phase 2 (Core DSL & Module Infrastructure) where we'll begin implementing the core functionality of DSPy.ts.
