This phase implements the core Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and module infrastructure for DSPy.ts. We'll create the foundational types, interfaces, and base classes that form the backbone of the framework.

/**
 * Defines the structure for input and output fields of a DSPy.ts module.
 */
/**
 * Base class for DSPy.ts modules.
 * Each module must define a signature and implement the run method.
/**
 * Executes a series of DSPy.ts modules as a pipeline.
 * Each module's output is passed as input to the next module.
 */
