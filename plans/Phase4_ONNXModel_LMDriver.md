This phase implements the ONNX Runtime Web integration for DSPy.ts, allowing the framework to run ONNX-format language models directly in JavaScript environments. The ONNXModel driver will handle model loading, tensor preparation, and inference execution.

3. Finally, integrate with DSPy.ts:
   - Export ONNXModel in index.ts
git add src/index.ts
git commit -m "Integrate ONNXModel with DSPy.ts framework"
```
- [ ] Memory management (cleanup) works properly
## Overview
- [ ] Integration with DSPy.ts modules is seamless
- [ ] All tests pass with good coverage
