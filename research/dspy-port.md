A detailed technical specification and functional overview of the DSPy capabilities and SDK that will be ported to DS.js. This document is intended to guide development by describing all core features, interfaces, and integration points that the original DSPy (Declarative Self‑Improving Python) library provides and how they map to the JavaScript/TypeScript environment in DS.js.

# 1. Introduction

**DSPy Overview:**  
DSPy is a framework originally written in Python for declaratively composing and optimizing language model (LM) pipelines. It abstracts prompt engineering into modular, self‑improving components. The goal of the DS.js port is to bring these capabilities to JavaScript, enabling seamless in‑browser or Node.js deployment with integrations for ONNX Runtime Web and JS‑PyTorch.

**DS.js Objectives:**  
- **Declarative DSL:** Provide a domain‑specific language (DSL) for defining LM modules with explicit input/output signatures.
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Chain modules into end‑to‑end pipelines for multi‑step reasoning.
- **Self‑Improvement:** Facilitate demonstration collection and prompt optimization to “teach” the LM to produce higher‑quality outputs.
- **Backend Agnostic LM Integration:** Abstract LM execution via configurable drivers (e.g., ONNX, JS‑PyTorch, API‑based).
- **Neural Computation:** Leverage tensor operations (via JS‑PyTorch) for any custom neural processing.

# 2. Functional Capabilities

## 2.1 Declarative DSL and Module System

- **Signature Definitions:**  
  Each module in DSPy defines its expected inputs and outputs using a typed schema. In DS.js, these will be expressed as TypeScript interfaces or JSON schemas:
  - *InputField* and *OutputField* definitions (e.g., field name, type, description).
  - A *Signature* object that encapsulates the complete I/O specification.

- **Module Classes and Strategies:**  
  The framework supports various module types:
  - **Predict Module:** Performs a single LM call by formatting a prompt and parsing the output.
  - **Chain-of-Thought Module:** Supports multi‑step reasoning by prompting the LM to “think aloud” before producing an answer.
  - **ReAct Module (Planned):** Combines reasoning with tool use, allowing modules to query external APIs or retrieval systems.
  
  Each module inherits from a base `Module<TInput, TOutput>` class that defines:
  - A **prompt template function** for converting structured input into a textual prompt.
  - A standard asynchronous `run()` method that:
    - Formats the prompt.
    - Calls the configured LM.
    - Parses and returns structured output.

## 2.2 Pipeline Orchestration

- **Execution Engine:**  
  DS.js will include a pipeline executor that:
  - Chains module calls sequentially or (in future versions) in parallel/conditional flows.
  - Propagates outputs from one module as inputs to subsequent ones.
  - Provides error handling, logging, and debugging hooks to trace data flow through the pipeline.

- **Asynchronous Operations:**  
  Given that LM inference and tensor operations are asynchronous, the pipeline executor must handle promises gracefully.

## 2.3 Self‑Improving Prompt Strategies

- **Demonstration Collection:**  
  The framework will collect “successful” LM outputs during execution. These demonstration examples can later be used to:
  - Adjust prompt templates automatically.
  - Fine‑tune module parameters or demonstration weights.
  
- **Optimization Engine (Future Enhancement):**  
  An optimizer component will analyze demonstration performance metrics (e.g., confidence scores, output quality) and update the DSL definitions accordingly. This supports iterative refinement of prompt strategies.

## 2.4 Language Model (LM) Integration

- **Abstract LM Driver Interface:**  
  DS.js will define an interface (e.g. `LMDriver`) that declares a `generate(prompt: string): Promise<string>` method. This allows the DS.js pipeline to remain decoupled from specific LM implementations.

- **ONNX Runtime Web Integration:**  
  One of the primary drivers will be an `ONNXModel` class (see detailed integration plan above) that:
  - Loads an ONNX‑formatted model using ONNX Runtime Web.
  - Translates structured input into tensors (tokenization and embedding conversion can be built as utility functions).
  - Executes inference and converts the output tensor back into structured data.
  
- **JS‑PyTorch Integration:**  
  For scenarios requiring custom tensor operations or dynamic computation (e.g., for gradient tracking or auxiliary neural modules), DS.js will also include a `TorchModel` driver that wraps JS‑PyTorch operations.

- **Fallback and Dummy LM:**  
  A dummy LM driver (e.g. `DummyLM`) will be provided for development and testing, returning canned responses to ensure consistent behavior in unit tests.

## 2.5 Neural Computation & Tensor Operations

- **Custom Neural Modules:**  
  DS.js modules can optionally incorporate neural computation steps (using JS‑PyTorch) to post‑process LM outputs or to compute intermediate tensor representations.
  
- **Autograd and Optimization:**  
  Though the MVP may only require forward inference, the design will accommodate autograd-based training or fine‑tuning routines in future releases.

## 2.6 Utility Functions and SDK Support

- **Prompt Formatting & Parsing:**  
  Utility modules (e.g., `formatter.ts` and `parser.ts`) will:
  - Convert structured module input into prompt text (handling string interpolation, formatting rules, etc.).
  - Parse raw LM outputs (e.g., numeric conversions, JSON parsing) to yield outputs matching the module’s signature.

- **Caching:**  
  An optional caching layer can be used to avoid repeated LM calls for identical inputs, improving performance.

- **Logging & Debugging:**  
  Detailed logging functions will be integrated for debugging pipelines, LM calls, and tensor operations. Developers can enable verbose mode to trace data flows.

- **Configuration API:**  
  Global functions (such as `configureLM(lm: LMDriver)` and `getLM()`) allow the DS.js user to set up and switch between different LM drivers seamlessly.

- **Testing Support:**  
  The SDK will include comprehensive Jest tests for each module and utility, ensuring each capability is validated independently.

## 3.1 Core Components

1. **DSL & Module Core:**  
   - `src/core/signature.ts`: Contains TypeScript interfaces for field definitions and module signatures.
   - `src/core/module.ts`: Defines the base `Module<TInput, TOutput>` class and common methods.
   - `src/core/pipeline.ts`: Implements a pipeline executor to chain modules and handle asynchronous execution.

2. **LM Drivers:**  
   - `src/lm/base.ts`: Exposes the LMDriver interface.
   - `src/lm/onnx.ts`: Implements the ONNXModel class using ONNX Runtime Web.
   - `src/lm/torch.ts`: Implements a TorchModel class wrapping JS‑PyTorch (for neural operations).
   - `src/lm/dummy.ts`: Provides a dummy LM driver for testing.

3. **Module Implementations:**  
   - `src/modules/predict.ts`: Implements the PredictModule as an example.
   - (Planned) Additional modules such as Chain-of-Thought or ReAct modules will follow similar patterns.

  - Define modules (e.g., using `defineModule` helper).
  - Configure global LM drivers.
  - Compose and run pipelines.
  
- **Extensible DSL:**  
  The DSL is designed to be open to future module types. Developers can extend the base module class to add new strategies without modifying core DS.js functionality.
