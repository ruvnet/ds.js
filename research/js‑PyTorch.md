## Overview of js‑PyTorch

[js‑PyTorch](https://eduardoleao052.github.io/js-pytorch/site/) is a JavaScript library that brings a PyTorch-like API to the web and Node.js environments. It is designed to allow developers to build, train, and run neural networks using familiar operations such as tensor creation, automatic differentiation, and model optimization. Key features include:

- **Tensor Operations:** Create and manipulate multidimensional arrays with operations like addition, multiplication, reshaping, etc.
- **Autograd:** Automatic differentiation support that lets you compute gradients for optimization.
- **Model Building:** Define models in a style similar to PyTorch’s `nn.Module`, allowing for modular, composable designs.
- **Training and Inference:** Support for training loops, loss functions, and optimizers, all in pure JavaScript.
- **Web & Node.js Compatibility:** Designed to run efficiently in browsers (using WebGL acceleration) and in Node.js for server-side applications.

## Installation and Setup

You can install js‑PyTorch either via npm or by directly including it in your HTML. Here are the two primary methods:

### NPM Installation

If you are using Node.js or a bundler (like Webpack or Vite) for browser projects, install js‑PyTorch via npm:

```bash
npm install js-pytorch
```

Then import it in your project:

```javascript
import * as torch from 'js-pytorch';
```

### Browser Integration via CDN

For quick demos or integration without a bundler, include the library using a CDN. In your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-pytorch@0.7.2/dist/torch.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // js‑PyTorch is now available via the global `torch` variable.
  const tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]);
  console.log(tensor.toString());
</script>
```

---

## Basic API Usage

Once installed, you can begin using js‑PyTorch just as you would with PyTorch in Python. Below are some basic examples.

### Creating and Manipulating Tensors

```javascript
// Create a tensor from an array
const a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]);
// Create another tensor (e.g., with shape [2,2])
const b = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]);

// Basic operations
const sum = a.add(10); // adds 10 to each element
console.log(sum.toString());

// Reshaping
const reshaped = b.reshape([4]);
console.log(reshaped.toString());
```

### Building a Simple Model

js‑PyTorch provides an API to define neural network layers and models. For example, you might define a simple feedforward network:

```javascript
// Define a custom model by extending the base Module
class SimpleModel extends torch.nn.Module {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.fc1 = new torch.nn.Linear(4, 3);
    this.fc2 = new torch.nn.Linear(3, 1);
  }
  
  // Forward method defines the computation
  forward(x) {
    x = this.fc1.forward(x).relu();
    x = this.fc2.forward(x);
    return x;
  }
}

// Create an instance of the model
const model = new SimpleModel();

// Create a dummy input tensor
const input = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]]);
const output = model.forward(input);
console.log(output.toString());
```

### Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)

For training models, you can leverage autograd to compute gradients:

```javascript
// Enable gradient tracking
const x = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], { requiresGrad: true });
const y = x.pow(2).sum();
y.backward();
console.log(x.grad.toString()); // Expected gradient: [6, 8]
```

## Integrating js‑PyTorch with DS.js

In the DS.js framework, js‑PyTorch can be used for custom neural operations or to implement an LM driver based on a JS‑PyTorch model. For instance, consider the following integration approach:

### 1. Create a Torch-Based LM Driver

Create a file such as `src/lm/torch.ts` (as shown in the DS.js MVP) that wraps a JS‑PyTorch model. In this module, you might perform basic tensor computations to simulate an LM call. For example:

```typescript
import { LMDriver } from "./base";
import * as torch from "js-pytorch";

/**
 * TorchModel implements LMDriver using js‑PyTorch.
 * Here, we simulate a simple tensor operation as a placeholder for a real model.
 */
export class TorchModel implements LMDriver {
  public async generate(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
    // Create a tensor based on prompt length (dummy computation)
    const promptTensor = torch.tensor([prompt.length]);
    const resultTensor = promptTensor.add(10); // dummy operation: prompt length + 10
    return `Torch response: ${resultTensor.dataSync()[0]} (prompt length + 10)`;
  }
}
```

### 2. Use the LM Driver in DS.js

Within DS.js, you can configure your language model driver to use the TorchModel:

```typescript
import { configureLM } from "ds.js";
import { TorchModel } from "ds.js/lm/torch";

// Configure DS.js to use TorchModel for LM operations
configureLM(new TorchModel());
```

Then, when you define modules in DS.js (e.g., using `defineModule`), they will use this Torch-based LM driver under the hood. This enables you to mix declarative prompt-based pipeline definitions with neural computations implemented via js‑PyTorch.

## Best Practices and Advanced Usage

### Performance Considerations

- **WebGL Acceleration:** When using js‑PyTorch in the browser, performance benefits are achieved through WebGL. Ensure that your browser environment supports it.
- **Batching:** For inference tasks, consider batching inputs to optimize tensor operations.
- **Memory Management:** Although JavaScript’s garbage collector handles memory cleanup, be mindful when creating many tensors; use `dispose()` methods if provided by the library to free memory.

### Debugging and Testing

- **Console Logging:** Use logging (or debugging tools in your IDE) to inspect tensor values and gradients during development.
- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests (e.g., using Jest) for any custom models or neural operations you build using js‑PyTorch. This ensures your integrations behave as expected.
- **Documentation:** Refer to the official [js‑PyTorch documentation](https://eduardoleao052.github.io/js-pytorch/site/) for in‑depth details on API usage, model building, and autograd functionality.

### Integration with DS.js Pipelines

Integrating js‑PyTorch into DS.js pipelines allows you to extend simple prompt-based modules with neural network computations. For example, if a module requires a custom transformer layer or a tensor-based post‑processing step, you can implement that using js‑PyTorch within your module’s logic. This keeps the DS.js pipeline modular while leveraging the powerful tensor operations available in js‑PyTorch.
