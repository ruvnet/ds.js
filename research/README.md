Understood. I will implement an MVP of DSPy.js with core DSPy functionality, ensuring a modular and extensible architecture for future enhancements. The project will be structured for deployment via npm and Node.js, utilizing ONNX Runtime Web and JS-PyTorch where applicable. Jest will be used for unit testing, and detailed documentation will be provided, including technical specifications, installation instructions, and a structured file/folder layout.

I will get back to you with the full implementation shortly.

# DSPy.js MVP – Technical Overview and Documentation

## Core Declarative Module System (DSPy.js Functionality)

**Declarative Modules:** DSPy.js adopts a *declarative module system* inspired by the Python DSPy framework. Instead of hard-coding prompts as long strings, developers define **modules** that describe input-output behavior for language model tasks. Each module declares what inputs it expects and what output it produces, abstracting away the prompt details. This lets you **program the AI’s behavior as code rather than crafting prompts** ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=To%20build%20reliable%20AI%20systems%2C,specific%20LMs%20or%20prompting%20strategies)). For example, a sentiment analysis module might declare an input text and output fields for sentiment and confidence, instead of writing a one-off prompt string for sentiment each time.

**Compositional LM Calls:** Modules can be **composed into pipelines**, meaning the output of one module can feed into the input of another. Under the hood, DSPy.js modules form a *text transformation graph* of computations ([DSPy: Compiling Declarative Language Model Calls into State-of-the-Art Pipelines | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sY5N0zY5Od#:~:text=hard,by%20creating%20and%20collecting%20demonstrations)). Each node in this graph is a module that may invoke an LM call or perform some transformation. By chaining modules, complex multi-step reasoning or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines can be constructed. This compositional approach enables building sophisticated workflows (e.g., retrieve context → answer question → refine answer) in a **clear, step-by-step fashion** rather than one giant prompt.

**Module Definition:** In DSPy.js, a module is typically defined either by extending a base `Module` class or by using a factory function with a declarative specification. The module definition includes: 

- **Input/Output Schema:** A declaration of input fields and output fields (with types or descriptions). This is analogous to DSPy’s *Signature* classes in Python, where you specify input/output types ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=Try%20the%20examples%20below%20after,answer)) ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=from%20typing%20import%20Literal)). In JavaScript/TypeScript, this could be done with a class definition or a JSON schema. For example: 

  ```ts
  // TypeScript example of a signature-like definition
  interface SentimentAnalysisIO {
    sentence: string; 
    sentiment: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral';
    confidence: number;
  }
  ```

  This defines that the module takes a **sentence** as input and produces a **sentiment** label and a **confidence** score as output.

- **LM Invocation Strategy:** Each module chooses a strategy for invoking the language model. In Python DSPy, examples include `Predict` (direct prompt-response), `ChainOfThought` (prompt the model to reason step-by-step), or `ReAct` (for tool-using agents) ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=Try%20the%20examples%20below%20after,answer)). In DSPy.js MVP, we will implement at least one core strategy (e.g. a direct prediction akin to `Predict`) and design the system to allow adding others. For instance, a *DirectPrompt* module type might simply format the input into a prompt and query the LM, whereas a *ChainOfThought* module type could prompt the model to produce a reasoning trace plus an answer.

- **Prompt Template or Logic:** The module either contains a prompt template or generation logic based on the input. For a simple MVP, this could be as straightforward as: `"Given {sentence}, determine sentiment and confidence."` for the above example. The framework will combine the template with input values to produce the final prompt. By keeping this logic within the module, **DSPy.js can auto-generate prompts from the structured specification** ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=DSPy%20shifts%20your%20focus%20from,portable%2C%20and%20optimizable%20AI%20systems)).

**Pipeline Execution:** Running a pipeline in DSPy.js means executing modules in sequence or as a directed graph. Each module’s output is passed to the next module as needed. The framework will provide a **pipeline executor** that manages this flow. In an MVP implementation, pipelines can be coded manually (e.g., call module A, then use its result to call module B). For ease of use, we will also support a simple declarative pipeline configuration – for example, an array of modules to apply in order, or a function that orchestrates calls. Internally, each module call may be asynchronous (since LM inference can be async), and the pipeline executor will handle these promises to ensure correct ordering.

**Example Usage:** After installing DSPy.js (see **Installation** below), a user might write code like the following to define and run modules:

```js
// Define a module (using a hypothetical Module subclass or factory)
const sentimentModule = DSPy.defineModule({
  name: "SentimentAnalyzer",
  inputs: ["sentence"],
  outputs: ["sentiment", "confidence"],
  strategy: "Predict",  // use direct LM prompt strategy
  promptTemplate: ({sentence}) => `What is the sentiment of the following text and how confident are you?\nText: "${sentence}"`
});

// Use the module:
await sentimentModule.run({ sentence: "I love this product, it's fantastic!" });
// => { sentiment: "positive", confidence: 0.95 }  (Example output)
```

In this example, `DSPy.defineModule` creates a module with a declarative specification. The `strategy` `"Predict"` tells DSPy.js to use a straightforward single-step LM call. The `promptTemplate` function generates the prompt using the input. When we call `run`, the framework formats the prompt, calls the configured LM, and then parses the LM’s response into the structured output (sentiment and confidence).

By enabling such high-level definitions, **developers can focus on what the AI should do (module inputs/outputs and behavior) instead of how to prompt the model** ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=To%20build%20reliable%20AI%20systems%2C,specific%20LMs%20or%20prompting%20strategies)). This core functionality lays the groundwork for building more complex pipelines and iterative improvements in the future.

## Modular and Extensible Architecture

**Separation of Concerns:** The DSPy.js architecture is designed to be modular, separating the core concerns of the framework: module definition, pipeline orchestration, and model execution. This decoupling makes it easy to extend or swap components without breaking the entire system ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=To%20build%20reliable%20AI%20systems%2C,specific%20LMs%20or%20prompting%20strategies)) ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=change%20your%20LM%2C%20metrics%2C%20or,specific%20LMs%20or%20prompting%20strategies)). For instance, the logic that formats prompts and parses outputs is separated from the logic that actually calls the neural model. This means if in the future we optimize prompt formatting or add new model backends, it can be done in isolation.

**Core Components:** We structure the code into clear components/layers:

- **Module Classes:** At the heart is a `Module` base class (or interface) that defines a standard API (e.g., a `run(input)` method). Specific module strategies (like *Predict*, *ChainOfThought*, etc.) will be subclasses of `Module`. Each subclass can implement its own approach to constructing prompts and post-processing outputs. New module types can be added by extending this base class, without altering the rest of the framework. *Example:* A future developer could create a new `ReActModule` subclass to implement the ReAct prompting technique (tool use with reasoning) and plug it into the system.

- **Language Model Interface:** We define an abstract interface for the language model (LM) backend. This interface (e.g., `LMDriver` class) exposes methods to **invoke the model** (e.g., `generate(text)` or `generate(inputs, options)`). The implementation of this interface can vary (OpenAI API, local ONNX runtime, etc.). By coding against an interface, our modules and pipeline logic do not need to know the details of how the model is implemented. This makes the system **extensible** – one can integrate a different model or provider by writing a new LM driver that conforms to the interface. For example, we might have `OpenAIModel`, `ONNXModel`, or `LocalTorchModel` classes that implement the `LMDriver` interface. Selecting or configuring the LM for the whole pipeline can be done at initialization (similar to how DSPy Python uses `dspy.configure(lm=...)` to set a default LM).

- **Pipeline Executor:** If a pipeline (a sequence or graph of modules) is defined, a pipeline executor component will manage the data flow. For MVP, this could be as simple as a function that takes an array of modules and an initial input, then calls each module in turn, feeding the output of one to the next. The executor handles asynchronous calls (using `async/await` or Promise chaining under the hood) so that the code remains clean. In the future, this could be extended to support branching pipelines or parallel module execution if needed. The pipeline executor ensures that **adding or reordering modules is easy**, and could even allow dynamic pipelines (e.g., if one module’s output determines which module runs next).

- **Utilities and Parsers:** Supporting components will include utilities for parsing LM outputs into structured data, caching results, logging, etc. For example, if an output field is declared as a number (float), the framework can attempt to parse the model’s text output into a numeric value. DSPy.js can incorporate lightweight parsing rules or even few-shot prompts to structure outputs (though the MVP will handle basic types). These utilities are kept modular so they can be improved or replaced (for instance, swapping in a more robust parser, or adding support for complex output types like JSON).

**Extensibility:** Thanks to this architecture, DSPy.js is highly extensible:

- **Add New Module Types:** Developers can introduce new strategies by subclassing the base Module. For example, one could add a `ChainOfThoughtModule` that internally calls the LM multiple times (first to generate a step-by-step reasoning, then to generate a final answer). This new module can be integrated without modifying existing modules. The system is open to extension but closed for modification in the classic software engineering sense – a principle that ensures stability as new features are added.

- **Swap or Add Model Backends:** The LM driver interface allows plugging in different model implementations. Today it might wrap ONNX Runtime for local inference; tomorrow it could wrap a HuggingFace Transformers pipeline or a remote API. The rest of the code (modules, pipelines) doesn’t need to change when the model backend changes, as long as the interface contract is met. This decoupling **decouples AI system design from specific LMs or prompting strategies** ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=change%20your%20LM%2C%20metrics%2C%20or,specific%20LMs%20or%20prompting%20strategies)), echoing DSPy’s philosophy. For instance, during development one could quickly switch from a small local model to a larger cloud model to compare outputs, by just changing the LM configuration.

- **Future Optimizations:** While the MVP focuses on baseline functionality, the architecture sets the stage for advanced features like *auto-optimization of prompts and modules* (as in the DSPy research ([DSPy: Compiling Declarative Language Model Calls into State-of-the-Art Pipelines | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sY5N0zY5Od#:~:text=text%20transformation%20graphs%2C%20or%20imperative,3.5%20and))). Since modules are declarative and parameterized, a future optimizer component could tweak prompt wording or few-shot examples for each module to improve performance. Our design anticipates integrating such an optimizer as a separate module or service that interfaces with the pipeline (e.g. by analyzing outputs and adjusting module parameters).

In summary, the architecture is **component-based** and organized for growth. Each piece (module logic, pipeline engine, model driver) can be developed and tested in isolation, and improved independently. This modular design not only eases maintenance but also fosters a plug-and-play ecosystem where community contributions (new modules, new backends, new optimizers) can be integrated with minimal friction.

## ONNX and JS-PyTorch Integration for Model Execution

To enable running language model computations within JavaScript, DSPy.js integrates with **ONNX Runtime Web** and **JS-PyTorch** for neural network execution.

**ONNX Runtime Web Integration:** ONNX Runtime Web allows us to run pre-trained neural network models (exported in ONNX format) directly in JavaScript environments, including browsers and Node.js. We will use the `onnxruntime-web` package as a backend for inference. This means that if you have a language model converted to ONNX (for example, a distilled Transformer), DSPy.js can load that model and execute it to generate outputs. ONNX Runtime Web is highly optimized and supports execution via WebAssembly and WebGL/WebGPU for acceleration ([Web | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/#:~:text=,offloading%20inference%20to%20the%20browser)) ([Web | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20use%20the,frontend%20of%20an%20electron%20app)). Using ONNX models has several advantages: it keeps inference **fast, secure, offline-capable, and cost-effective by running on the client side** ([Web | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/#:~:text=,cloud%20serving%20costs%20by%20offloading)). In practical terms, DSPy.js will provide an `ONNXModel` class (implementing the LM interface) where you can do something like:

```js
import * as ort from 'onnxruntime-web';
const session = await ort.InferenceSession.create('./model.onnx');
DSPy.configureLM(new ONNXModel(session));
```

Under the hood, the `ONNXModel` class handles preparing the inputs (tokenizing text if needed, creating the input tensor), running `session.run(...)`, and converting the model’s output tensor back into text. This happens asynchronously using ONNX Runtime’s API. By integrating at this level, **any ONNX-exported language model can be plugged into DSPy.js**. This could range from GPT-2 like models to smaller specialized models for classification, etc., as long as they’re in ONNX format. *(Note: Very large models might be slow in pure JS/WASM, but the system is designed to handle smaller LMs well – appropriate for an MVP.)*

**JS-PyTorch Integration:** In addition to ONNX, we include **JS-PyTorch** as an option for defining or running models in JavaScript. JS-PyTorch is a library that mirrors the PyTorch API for JavaScript, allowing you to train and run neural networks with GPU acceleration via WebGL (using GPU.js under the hood) ([eduardoleao052/js-pytorch: A JavaScript library like ... - GitHub](https://github.com/eduardoleao052/js-pytorch#:~:text=GitHub%20github.com%20%20JS,js)). This is useful for scenarios where you might want to implement a custom neural component or do on-the-fly computations that are easier to express imperatively. For example, if a pipeline step requires computing an embedding or a small classifier, one could use JS-PyTorch to define that model directly in code (without needing an ONNX export).

DSPy.js can integrate JS-PyTorch in two ways:
1. **Model Definition:** Provide a means to register a `LocalTorchModel` (as an LM driver) that wraps a JS-PyTorch model. For instance, you could define a simple neural network in JS-PyTorch (say, a small feed-forward network for classification) and then have a module use it for inference. The `LocalTorchModel` would handle feeding input data into the JS-PyTorch model and returning outputs. This is more relevant for non-language-model components (since large language models are not feasible to train from scratch in JS-PyTorch, but small networks are).
2. **Utility Computations:** Use JS-PyTorch for any tensor operations needed during processing. For example, maybe a module needs to post-process LM output by computing softmax on a logits vector; JS-PyTorch can do this easily using familiar operations (`torch.softmax` etc.). Incorporating JS-PyTorch ensures we have a **flexible, PyTorch-like toolset in JavaScript** ([JS-PyTorch](https://eduardoleao052.github.io/js-pytorch/site/#:~:text=%2A%20JS,code%2C%20visit%20the%20GitHub%20repo)) for any neural computation that isn’t directly an LM generation.

By having both ONNX and JS-PyTorch, our framework can cover both **pre-trained model inference** and **custom model logic**:
- ONNX is ideal for running *large, pre-trained transformer models* (converted from PyTorch or TensorFlow) efficiently in JS ([Web | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/#:~:text=ONNX%20Runtime%20Web%20enables%20you,flow%20through%20the%20development%20process)).
- JS-PyTorch is ideal for *defining new models or layers* on the fly, or for tasks like fine-tuning in-browser (within limitations) because it supports training and GPU acceleration in Node or browser environments ([JS-PyTorch](https://eduardoleao052.github.io/js-pytorch/site/#:~:text=%2A%20JS,or%20on%20a%20web%20browser)).

**Example Integration Scenario:** Suppose we want to include a question-answering module that uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT QA model. We could convert that model to ONNX and load it via ONNX Runtime. Meanwhile, for a simple sentiment classifier, we might directly code a small logistic regression in JS-PyTorch and train it on the fly (or load pre-trained weights) in the browser. Both would seamlessly plug into the DSPy.js pipeline: the QA module using ONNXModel, and the sentiment module using a LocalTorchModel. The pipeline executor and module interfaces remain the same.

**Performance and Constraints:** We will document and handle the performance considerations of these integrations. ONNXRuntime may use WebAssembly threads and need proper initialization; JS-PyTorch may rely on WebGL for GPU – thus the user might need to run on a compatible environment (modern browser or Node with GPU.js). For Node.js usage, ONNXRuntime can also use the NodeJS binding (onnxruntime-node) for better performance on server, and JS-PyTorch works with Node’s GPU.js for acceleration. Our architecture ensures these details are abstracted behind the LM interface, so from the module’s perspective it’s just calling `await lm.generate(prompt)` regardless of whether it’s ONNX or JS-PyTorch under the hood.

By utilizing ONNX Runtime Web and JS-PyTorch, **DSPy.js empowers developers to execute advanced language model pipelines completely in JavaScript**, leveraging client-side compute when possible. This aligns with the goal of easy deployment (no external Python servers needed) and the open-source ethos of using standard model formats ([Web | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/#:~:text=ONNX%20Runtime%20Web%20enables%20you,flow%20through%20the%20development%20process)) and tools available in the JS ecosystem.

## Unit Testing Strategy (Jest) and Quality Assurance

**Testing Framework:** We will use **Jest** as the testing framework to implement comprehensive unit tests for DSPy.js. Jest is a widely used testing library in the JavaScript ecosystem that supports assertions, mocking, and async testing out of the box, all of which are crucial for a framework that deals with asynchronous model calls.

**Unit Tests for Modules:** Every module type and function in DSPy.js will have dedicated unit tests. For example, if we have a `PredictModule` class, we will test:
- Prompt formatting logic: Given a known input, does the module produce the expected prompt string?
- Output parsing: Given a fake or example LM response, does the module correctly extract the structured outputs (e.g., types and fields)? If the module expects a number and reasoning text, we might simulate an LM output and verify we parse the number accurately.
- Error handling: If required fields are missing or the LM output is malformed, does the module throw a readable error or handle it gracefully?

To make these tests deterministic and precise, we will **mock the LM interface**. Instead of calling a real model, we inject a stub LM that returns preset outputs. For instance, we can create a `DummyLM` class implementing the LM interface where `generate(prompt)` returns a fixed response or one computed by a simple rule. This allows us to test module behavior without variability. By isolating the module from the actual model, tests can reliably verify the logic that’s under our control.

**Pipeline Execution Tests:** We will also test the pipeline orchestration. For a given sequence of modules, we can use stub modules (or real ones with stub LMs) to verify that data flows correctly:
- Test that the output of module A is passed as input to module B where appropriate (including field name matching).
- Test that asynchronous execution waits for one module to finish before the next starts, preserving order.
- Simulate branching or optional modules (if the design allows) to ensure the executor correctly follows the pipeline definition.

If our pipeline supports conditional logic or loops in the future, we would add tests for those as well. For the MVP’s straightforward pipelines, we check sequence integrity and final output correctness given known intermediate results.

**Integration Tests:** In addition to unit tests of individual components, some integration tests will ensure that all pieces work together. For example, using a **small actual model** with ONNX or JS-PyTorch in a test:
- We might include a very small ONNX model (or a trivial JS-PyTorch model) in the test suite to run a real inference through the system. This can be a model that, say, echoes input or does a simple transformation, so that we know what output to expect. This kind of test covers the end-to-end flow: module -> LM driver -> model -> back to module output.
- Integration tests also cover that the configuration (e.g., setting up `DSPy.configureLM(...)`) properly applies to modules when run, or that the overall library can be imported and a simple module executed without error.

**Advanced Test Scenarios:** We plan for *PhD-level precision* in testing, meaning we consider edge cases and rigorous validation:
- **Edge Cases:** Tests will cover edge inputs, such as empty strings, extremely long strings (to see if our prompt handling can manage or if we need to chunk), invalid types (passing number where string expected, etc., to ensure the system either handles or throws a clear error).
- **Determinism and Reproducibility:** While language model outputs are generally non-deterministic, our test doubles (mocks) will produce deterministic outputs. We ensure that any stochastic processes (like random sampling if used) can be seeded or stubbed during tests. This is important for reproducible test results.
- **Performance** (Basic): We won’t do full load testing in unit tests, but we might include a test that runs a simple module many times in a loop to ensure no memory leaks and acceptable performance for small batches. This gives early warning if our integration with ONNX or JS-PyTorch has resource cleanup issues (e.g., forgetting to free a session or tensor).
- **Concurrency:** If the design allows multiple modules or calls in parallel (future feature), we would test thread-safety or race conditions. For MVP, most calls are sequential, but we still test that two independent module instances can run simultaneously without interfering (especially if there are any shared singletons like a global LM instance, we must ensure it’s handled safely).

**Mocking and Stubbing:** Jest’s mocking capabilities will be used to simulate different behaviors:
- We can mock the `onnxruntime-web` session to test how our `ONNXModel` class handles model outputs (for instance, simulate a model returning a certain tensor).
- Similarly, we might mock parts of `js-pytorch` if needed, though it might be simpler to use an actual small JS-PyTorch tensor operation for real (since it’s lightweight for tests).
- For modules that call external tools or APIs (if any, e.g., a web search function in a RAG pipeline), we will mock those calls so tests remain self-contained and do not rely on network.

**Coverage and Quality Metrics:** We aim for a high test coverage (ideally **90%+** of lines). Each function or method introduced in the code will have corresponding tests. Furthermore, the **testing guidelines** will be documented for contributors:
- New modules should come with tests that cover their prompt and output logic.
- Any bug fix should include a regression test.
- We will enforce these through a continuous integration setup (running `npm test` on each pull request, for example).
- If feasible, property-based testing could be employed for certain parts (for instance, ensure that for all reasonable inputs of a function, some property holds).

By employing rigorous unit and integration testing with Jest, we ensure that **DSPy.js’s core is reliable and behaves as specified**. The thorough testing strategy reflects an academic level of precision and confidence in correctness, which is crucial for a framework meant to be a foundation for complex AI systems.

## Deployment Setup (npm & Node.js)

Preparing DSPy.js for deployment involves configuring it as a standard npm package and ensuring compatibility with Node.js (and bundlers for web). Key steps and considerations in the deployment setup include:

- **Project Configuration:** We maintain a `package.json` with all necessary fields:
  - **Name and Version:** The package might be named `"dspy-js"` (or similar) on npm. We follow semantic versioning (starting at 0.1.0 for the MVP).
  - **Entry Points:** We specify a main entry (e.g., `"main": "dist/index.js"` for CommonJS and `"module": "dist/index.esm.js"` for ES Module) so that the package works seamlessly with different import systems. If using TypeScript, we'll compile to JS before publishing and also include type declarations (`"types": "dist/index.d.ts"`).
  - **Dependencies:** List runtime dependencies like `onnxruntime-web` and `js-pytorch` (and perhaps smaller ones like any text processing library if used). Dev dependencies will include Jest and any build tools.
  - **Scripts:** Include scripts for `"build"`, `"test"`, and `"prepublish"` to automate the preparation steps.

- **Build Process:** If the project is written in TypeScript or uses modern JS that needs transpilation, a build step (using tools like `tsc` or Babel + Webpack/Rollup) will produce the output in the `dist/` folder. The build will ensure that the package can be imported in Node environments. We will configure the bundler carefully to handle `onnxruntime-web` which includes WebAssembly files. Usually, `onnxruntime-web` will automatically load its WASM binaries from a CDN or local path; we ensure our package either leaves this default intact or documents how to host the WASM if running offline. For Node.js usage, we might prefer the `onnxruntime-node` package for better performance – in such case, our LM interface could detect environment (Node vs browser) and choose the appropriate ONNX runtime backend.

- **npm Publishing:** We prepare the project so that publishing to npm is straightforward. This includes:
  - Cleaning out source maps or non-essential files, including only the necessary files in the package (we can use the `files` field in package.json or a `.npmignore` to exclude tests and source if not needed).
  - Verifying that license information (likely MIT, given DSPy’s open-source nature) is included.
  - Ensuring no sensitive information in the repo (like model files or large binaries) are published inadvertently.

- **Node.js Compatibility:** We will test the built package in a Node.js environment (LTS version, e.g., Node 18 or Node 20) to ensure it can be required/imported without issues. This includes verifying that dynamic imports or WASM loading in ONNX runtime do not break. If any native addons were required (not likely for ONNX Web, since it’s pure WASM, but `onnxruntime-node` uses native code), we ensure they are properly declared and installed. The goal is that a user can run `npm install dspy-js` and then use the library immediately in their Node project.

- **Browser Bundling:** Although npm packages are typically used in Node or through bundlers, we also consider direct browser usage. We might provide a UMD bundle (universal bundle) that attaches `DSPy` to the window, including the necessary parts of onnxruntime-web and js-pytorch. This can be generated via a bundler output. This way, users can include a single `<script>` tag (or a couple of tags) to play with DSPy.js in an HTML page (similar to how JS-PyTorch provides a CDN bundle ([JS-PyTorch](https://eduardoleao052.github.io/js-pytorch/site/#:~:text=To%20run%20JS,tag%20from%20the%20cdnjs%20website))). For the MVP, we document how to do this rather than include heavy bundles by default, to keep package size small. For example, we may instruct: *to use in a browser, include the ONNX Runtime Web script and JS-PyTorch script via CDN, then include our UMD bundle*.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** As part of deployment prep, we set up CI (like GitHub Actions) to run tests on each commit and perhaps to automate npm publishing on new tags. While not strictly part of the user-visible deployment, this ensures that any deployment is of a tested, stable build. It also helps maintain code quality as the project grows.

In summary, the deployment setup ensures **DSPy.js is packaged as a clean, professional-grade library**. The npm and Node.js focus means that integration into real projects will be smooth. Users can add DSPy.js as a dependency and rely on our setup to handle the heavy lifting (like including the right binaries for ONNX). The emphasis on both Node and browser viability means the MVP is flexible for various environments, aligning with the goal of easy deployment and use.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

For users and developers looking to install and use DSPy.js, the process will be straightforward:

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (>= LTS version) installed if you plan to use DSPy.js in Node. If using in a web browser without a bundler, be ready to include additional scripts for ONNX and JS-PyTorch (detailed below). No Python environment is needed – everything runs in JavaScript.

**Installation via npm:** DSPy.js will be published on npm. You can install it using:

```bash
npm install dspy-js   # Install the DSPy.js MVP package
```

This will fetch the package and its dependencies (which include `onnxruntime-web` and `js-pytorch`). The package is then ready to be imported in your code.

**Importing the Library:** Depending on your environment or module system:
- In Node.js (CommonJS): use `const DSPy = require('dspy-js');`
- In ES Module or TypeScript: use `import * as DSPy from 'dspy-js';` or named imports if provided (e.g., `import { defineModule, configureLM } from 'dspy-js';`).

After importing, you may need to configure the language model backend. By default, DSPy.js might come with a default LM driver that is a no-op or requires configuration. For example, to use a local ONNX model:
```js
const ort = require('onnxruntime-web');
const DSPy = require('dspy-js');

// Load an ONNX model (assuming you have model.onnx in your working directory)
const session = await ort.InferenceSession.create('model.onnx');
DSPy.configureLM(new DSPy.ONNXModel(session));
```
If you prefer to use OpenAI or another API (not covered directly in MVP, but possibly via extension), you would configure a different LM driver here.

**Browser Usage:** To use DSPy.js in a browser without a bundler, include the necessary scripts in your HTML:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/onnxruntime-web/1.15.0/ort.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-pytorch/0.7.2/js-pytorch-browser.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/dspy-js.umd.js"></script>  <!-- our bundled UMD if provided -->
<script>
  // Now DSPy is available as a global variable, or via DSPy namespace
  const { defineModule, configureLM, ONNXModel } = DSPy;

  // Setup and use DSPy.js as shown in examples
</script>
```
In the above, we loaded ONNX Runtime and JS-PyTorch from CDNs (versions are examples; use the latest). Then we include DSPy.js UMD bundle which attaches the DSPy library to the global scope. Now we can call DSPy’s functions in the script. If you use a bundler like Webpack, you can instead import the modules normally and it will handle including those dependencies.

**Configuration:** After installation, a typical first step is to configure the language model. We provide `DSPy.configureLM()` to set a default LM driver. If not configured, modules may throw an error when you try to run them, reminding you to configure an LM. This design is similar to DSPy Python’s `dspy.configure(lm=...)` usage. Configuration can also include setting global options like default generation parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.), although each module run can override those if needed.

**Quick Start Example:** Once installed and configured, here’s a quick start to ensure everything is set up correctly:
```js
// Import and configure a dummy LM (for demonstration)
import { defineModule, configureLM, DummyLM } from 'dspy-js';
configureLM(new DummyLM());  // DummyLM might produce canned outputs for testing

// Define a simple module
const helloModule = defineModule({
  name: "HelloModule",
  inputs: ["name"],
  outputs: ["greeting"],
  promptTemplate: ({name}) => `Hello, ${name}!`,  // trivial prompt
  strategy: "Predict"
});

// Run the module
helloModule.run({ name: "World" }).then(output => {
  console.log(output.greeting);  // Expected: "Hello, World!" or similar output from the dummy LM
});
```
If you see the correct greeting printed, your DSPy.js installation is working. In a real scenario, you’d replace `DummyLM` with an actual LM driver, such as ONNXModel loaded with a real model. The above code is just to illustrate usage.

**Troubleshooting Installation:** Our documentation will include a FAQ or troubleshooting tips, e.g.:
- If ONNX Runtime fails to load a model in the browser, ensure the WASM assets are accessible (we might direct users to ONNX Runtime docs for hosting the `.wasm` files, or mention the need for a secure context for WebAssembly threads).
- If JS-PyTorch is not found, make sure the script tag is included or the npm package is properly installed.
- Common Node-gyp issues (if any native components, though unlikely with pure WASM) and how to resolve them.

The installation and setup are designed to be as simple as possible: one npm install and a small amount of configuration code to select your model. After that, users can declare modules and pipelines and start obtaining results from their language models using DSPy.js.

```

**Source Code (src/):** We separate `core`, `lm`, `modules`, and `utils`:
- The `core` folder holds the generic framework code. Notably, `module.js` and `pipeline.js` which are central to how modules are represented and executed. By isolating these, anyone looking to understand or modify fundamental behavior knows where to look.
- The `lm` folder encapsulates anything to do with model backends. Each file corresponds to a different integration (ONNX, Torch, etc.). This means if one wants to add a new backend, they can add a new file here (and register it in `index.js` as needed) without touching the rest of the system.
- The `modules` folder contains higher-level module implementations that use the core. For MVP, `predict.js` will implement a direct LM call module. Even if ChainOfThought and ReAct are not fully implemented in MVP, we leave placeholders or plans for them, keeping the structure ready. Each module type could potentially have its own file for clarity.
- The `utils` folder has helper logic, like parsing LM outputs (e.g., splitting reasoning vs answer text), formatting inputs into prompts (maybe dealing with newline separations, etc.), and caching. In MVP, caching might be a simple in-memory cache by prompt to avoid repeated calls during dev, and can be expanded later. By keeping these separate, we can improve or replace them (for example, using a more advanced parsing approach) without altering core logic.

All public-facing classes/functions are re-exported in `index.js`, so the user can import from `"dspy-js"` without knowing the internal file structure. This also allows us to hide internal-only utilities from the public API.

**Tests (tests/):** We co-locate tests in a parallel structure:
- Each major component has a corresponding `*.spec.js` (or `.test.js`) file. For example, `test_module.spec.js` will cover the Module base and maybe a dummy subclass, `test_pipeline.spec.js` covers pipeline flows, etc.
- By naming with `.spec.js` and placing in a tests directory, Jest will pick them up. We ensure tests are comprehensive (as described in the Testing section above).
- End-to-end tests might simulate user-level usage (like the example scripts) to ensure the whole stack works.
- We also include tests specifically for integrations: `test_onnx.spec.js` might mock an ONNX session or use a tiny model file to ensure our ONNXModel works as expected. Similarly for the Torch integration.

**Examples (examples/):** Having an `examples` directory (or possibly just using the README) helps new users see how to use the library. In MVP, this could contain a few self-contained scripts demonstrating different scenarios (e.g., a simple Q&A pipeline, a classification task, etc.). These examples are also a form of documentation and can be manually run to verify the library’s behavior in a realistic setting.

**Documentation (docs/ or README):** The README.md will serve as the entry point for documentation, containing an introduction, installation guide, basic usage, and maybe linking to more detailed docs. For more in-depth technical discussions (like design rationale, advanced testing guidelines, etc.), we could use a `docs/` folder or a wiki. Since the question asks for technical documentation including specs, structure, and testing, we assume this content (or a version of it) would be part of the project’s documentation for developers.

This structured layout ensures that developers can quickly find relevant code. For example, if something is wrong with ONNX inference, one knows to look under `src/lm/onnx.js`. If it’s about how a module formats its prompt, check `src/modules/predict.js` or the `utils/formatter.js`. This clarity is important for an open-source project to encourage collaboration and extension.

## Testing Guidelines and Best Practices

Beyond just having tests, we will provide **guidelines for writing and running tests** to maintain the high quality of the project:

- **How to Run Tests:** Developers can run `npm test` to execute the Jest test suite. We might also provide `npm run coverage` to generate a coverage report. The documentation will mention this, and how to interpret the results (ensuring all tests pass before contributing code).

- **Writing New Tests:** When contributors add a new feature or module, they should also add corresponding tests. We’ll document patterns to follow:
  - Use descriptive test case names. For example: *"PredictModule should format prompt with input values"* or *"Pipeline executor should pass output of first module as input to second module"*.
  - Prefer using the provided dummy or mock LMs for testing to avoid external dependencies or flakiness.
  - Test the expected behavior including success paths and failure modes (e.g., what happens if the LM returns an empty string? The module should perhaps throw an error or handle it).
  - Keep tests independent of each other. Each test should set up its own module or pipeline instance to avoid cross-test interference (particularly important if using any global config like `configureLM` – tests should reset or use local LM instances).

- **Advanced Testing Techniques:** Encourage use of Jest features for robust testing:
  - **Mocking Modules:** If a test is focusing on pipeline logic, and we don’t want the actual module’s complexity, we can mock a module. For example, create a fake module that just returns a predefined output when run. This way pipeline logic can be tested in isolation from LM generation details.
  - **Snapshot Testing:** For certain stable outputs (like the exact prompt text generated by a module, or a JSON output structure), we could use Jest’s snapshot testing to detect regressions. This is useful once the prompt templates and output formats stabilize – any change will make the snapshot test fail, prompting a review if that change was intended.
  - **Performance Testing in CI:** While unit tests focus on correctness, we might include a simple performance benchmark in the test suite (or as a separate script) to track any major slowdowns. For instance, measure time to run 100 inferences on a dummy model and ensure it stays within expected range. This isn’t a strict unit test (as timing can vary), but can be used informally to catch performance regressions.

- **Continuous Integration:** We will set up continuous integration such that all tests must pass before merging changes. This guideline will be in our contributing docs, emphasizing that contributors should run the full test suite. A PhD-level attention to detail means we treat our test suite as a first-class citizen – updates to the code should maintain or improve coverage and not break existing tests.

- **Documentation of Test Cases:** We keep our test code well-documented, as it serves as an executable specification of the system. Key test cases might be referenced in documentation to illustrate how the system should behave. For example, we might cite in docs: *“As verified by our tests, the pipeline executor will maintain input-output alignment even if fields are re-ordered”*, giving users and devs confidence in specific behaviors.

- **Edge Case Catalog:** Over time, we will build a catalog of edge cases (possibly in the docs or comments) that the system handles, such as:
  - Extremely long input truncation: ensure we test how prompts are handled if input is too long (maybe the module should truncate or error – the chosen behavior is tested).
  - Unexpected model output: e.g., model not following the format – perhaps our parser should handle or flag it. Tests will simulate a model returning gibberish when a number is expected, to see that we handle the exception.
  - Multi-language inputs: if relevant, test that modules don’t break with non-English text (this might be more integration testing with an actual model that can handle it).

By adhering to these testing guidelines, we ensure that **every aspect of DSPy.js is validated** and that the codebase remains maintainable as it grows. This level of rigor is comparable to what one would expect in an academic or mission-critical software project, aligning with the request for high precision and thoroughness.
