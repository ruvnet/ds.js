## Integrating js‑PyTorch with DSPy.ts

In the DSPy.ts framework, js‑PyTorch can be used for custom neural operations or to implement an LM driver based on a JS‑PyTorch model. For instance, consider the following integration approach:

Create a file such as `src/lm/torch.ts` (as shown in the DSPy.ts MVP) that wraps a JS‑PyTorch model. In this module, you might perform basic tensor computations to simulate an LM call. For example:

### 2. Use the LM Driver in DSPy.ts

Within DSPy.ts, you can configure your language model driver to use the TorchModel:

// Configure DSPy.ts to use TorchModel for LM operations
configureLM(new TorchModel());

Then, when you define modules in DSPy.ts (e.g., using `defineModule`), they will use this Torch-based LM driver under the hood. This enables you to mix declarative prompt-based pipeline definitions with neural computations implemented via js‑PyTorch.

### Integration with DSPy.ts Pipelines

Integrating js‑PyTorch into DSPy.ts pipelines allows you to extend simple prompt-based modules with neural network computations. For example, if a module requires a custom transformer layer or a tensor-based post‑processing step, you can implement that using js‑PyTorch within your module's logic. This keeps the DSPy.ts pipeline modular while leveraging the powerful tensor operations available in js‑PyTorch.

- **Basic Usage:** Create tensors, define models, and run computations similar to PyTorch.
- **Integration with DSPy.ts:** Implement LM drivers using js‑PyTorch (e.g., `TorchModel`) and configure DSPy.ts to use them.
- **Advanced Topics:** Leverage autograd, batching, and WebGL acceleration for better performance, and ensure robust testing.

This guide should give you a full overview and actionable steps for using and integrating js‑PyTorch within your DSPy.ts framework or other JavaScript/TypeScript projects.
