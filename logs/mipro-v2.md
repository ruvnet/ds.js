# MIPROv2 Module Implementation

## Overview
Added MIPROv2 module that implements mixed initiative prompting with confidence scoring. The module integrates with the existing LMDriver infrastructure and provides a robust way to handle prompts with optional context.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
- MIPROv2Module class extending base Module
- Integration with LMDriver for text generation
- Confidence scoring based on output length
- Comprehensive error handling

### Features
- Context-aware prompt templating
- Configurable confidence thresholds
- Error recovery with fallback responses
- Full test coverage

### Testing
Added comprehensive test suite covering:
- Basic functionality
- Context handling
- Error scenarios
- Confidence scoring for various output lengths

## Technical Notes
- Uses TypeScript for type safety
- Follows project patterns and practices
- Integrates with existing module infrastructure
- All tests passing with good coverage

## Future Improvements
- Add more sophisticated confidence scoring
- Support for streaming responses
