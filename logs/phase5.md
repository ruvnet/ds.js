# Phase 5: Test Coverage Report

## Test Results Summary
- Total Test Suites: 11 passed, 11 total
- Total Tests: 67 passed, 67 total
- Coverage:
  - Statements: 93.8%
  - Branches: 91.48%
  - Functions: 93.61%
  - Lines: 94.63%

## Coverage by Component

### Core (97.1%)
- module.ts: 95.34%
- pipeline.ts: 100%
- signature.ts: 100%

### Language Models (91.05%)
- base.ts: 100%
- dummy.ts: 100%
- onnx.ts: 86.84%
- torch.ts: 90.9%

### Utils (100%)
- onnx-helpers.ts: 100%
- torch-helpers.ts: 100%

## Notes
- All core components have excellent coverage
- Pipeline error handling properly tested (console.error in tests is expected behavior)
- Language model implementations show strong coverage
- Utility functions are fully covered
- Minor uncovered lines in ONNX and Torch implementations relate to error handling paths

## Next Steps
- Address remaining uncovered lines in ONNX and Torch implementations
- Add integration tests for complete pipelines
- Document testing approach and coverage requirements
