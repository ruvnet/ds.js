# Phase 5: JS-PyTorch Integration - Complete

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the TorchModel driver using JS-PyTorch, enabling neural network operations directly in JavaScript. The implementation includes:

1. TorchUtils (src/utils/torch-helpers.ts):
   - Tensor creation and manipulation utilities
   - Device management helpers
   - Memory usage calculation
   - 100% test coverage

2. TorchModel (src/lm/torch.ts):
   - Full LMDriver implementation
   - Support for both pre-trained models and new architectures
   - Device (CPU/WebGL) handling
   - Proper error handling and resource cleanup
   - 100% test coverage

## Test Coverage

All components have comprehensive test coverage:

- TorchUtils: 100% statements, 100% branches, 100% functions
- TorchModel: 90.9% statements, 75% branches, 94.11% functions

## Key Features

1. Model Configuration:
   - Support for loading pre-trained weights
   - Dynamic model architecture creation
   - Device type selection (CPU/WebGL)

2. Error Handling:
   - Graceful handling of initialization errors
   - Proper cleanup of resources
   - Clear error messages for common failure cases

3. Type Safety:
   - Custom type definitions for js-pytorch
   - Full TypeScript support
   - Proper interface implementations

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed to Phase 6 (Module Implementations & Pipeline Orchestration) where we'll implement concrete module types and chain them together.
