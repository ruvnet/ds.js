# Phase 4: ONNX LM Driver Implementation - Complete

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the ONNX model driver with the following components:

1. ONNX Utilities (src/utils/onnx-helpers.ts):
   - Implemented tensor creation and manipulation utilities
   - Added model metadata validation
   - 100% test coverage for utility functions

2. ONNX Model Driver (src/lm/onnx.ts):
   - Implemented LMDriver interface
   - Added model initialization and cleanup
   - Implemented basic inference pipeline
   - Added error handling and type safety
   - Test coverage: 86.84% statements, 89.18% lines, 84.61% branches

## Test Results

All tests passing:
- Initialization tests ✓
